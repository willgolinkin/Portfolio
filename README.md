goals for HTML/CSS:
-add js for projects in top nav (once I have a lot of them)
-add flexbox for buttons (set width worked better)
-add skills used section to project with icons (html, css, javascript, jQuery)

js structure:
-will need to build out next button and 'renderNextProject' function once I have more than one project IOT see all work on a page by page basis
-potentially use hamburger for topnav using JS
