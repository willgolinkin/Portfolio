goals for HTML/CSS:
-add js for projects in top nav
-add hero image with responsive design (either flexbox or media query)
-add flexbox for buttons
-add icons or hamburger for bottom nav contact info
-maintain contact info near bio as a section

js structure:
-hide bio and render first project on click
-use next button to see all work on a page by page basis
-potentially use hamburger for topnav using JS
